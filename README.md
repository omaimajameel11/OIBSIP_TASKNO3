# Email Spam Detector

This project aims to build an email spam detector using Python and machine learning techniques. The objective is to develop a model capable of recognizing and classifying emails into spam and non-spam categories, thereby helping users identify and filter out unwanted or potentially harmful emails.

## Problem Statement

Email spam, also known as junk mail, poses a significant threat to email users by inundating their inboxes with unwanted messages, including scams, phishing attempts, and irrelevant content. This project addresses the challenge of automatically detecting spam emails to enhance email security and user experience.

## Dataset

The primary dataset for this project consists of labeled email samples, where each email is classified as either spam or non-spam (ham). The dataset may be sourced from public repositories, research datasets, or proprietary sources. It should include a diverse range of spam and non-spam emails to train a robust spam detection model.

## Approach

The project follows these general steps:

1. **Data Collection**: Gather labeled email samples from reliable sources, ensuring a balanced distribution of spam and non-spam emails. Preprocess the data to extract relevant features and convert emails into a suitable format for machine learning.

2. **Feature Extraction**: Extract features from the email data, such as the presence of specific keywords, email headers, sender information, and email body characteristics. Additionally, perform text preprocessing techniques like tokenization, stemming, and vectorization to represent emails numerically.

3. **Model Selection**: Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms for email classification. Commonly used models include Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Neural Networks. Experiment with different models to determine the most effective approach.

4. **Model Training**: Train the selected machine learning model using the labeled email dataset. Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance accurately. Fine-tune model parameters and optimize performance using techniques like cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning.

5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the trained model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve. Assess the model's ability to distinguish between spam and non-spam emails and identify any misclassifications or false positives/negatives.

6. **Deployment**: Deploy the trained model as an email spam filter or integrate it into email client applications to automatically classify incoming emails in real-time. Monitor the model's performance and periodically update it with new data to adapt to evolving spam patterns and tactics.

## Results

The trained email spam detection model achieves a high level of accuracy in classifying emails as spam or non-spam, effectively reducing the risk of users being exposed to malicious or unwanted content. Continuous monitoring and updates ensure the model remains effective against emerging spam threats.
The trained model achieves an accuracy of 90%.
